# Andrew's freeCodeCamp Projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/freecodecamp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/freecodecamp)

This is a repository for the freeCodeCamp projects developed by [Andrew Steffey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/asteffey).

### Contents

This repository is organized by each of the different freeCodeCamp certifications I worked on.

[Responsive Web Design](responsive-web-design)
[Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
[Front End Libraries](front-end-libraries-projects)
[Data Visualization](data-visualization-projects)
[APIs and Microservices](apis-and-microservices-projects)

A project page is also available at https://asteffey.github.io/freecodecamp.

### Background

I started working on these projects back in 2018 as a way to familiarize myself with modern web development practices.
I've known HTML since high school, and picked up basic Javascript during my college years, but hadn't been using it
on a regular basis until I undertook a front-end project for work around 2016. For that project, I ended up using JQuery and its
[DataTables](https://datatables.net/) plugin as it was a really good fit for the situation. However, during my initial research
I was really surprised by all these really impressive front-end frameworks, like Angular and React, and I wanted to learn
more.

After a lot of reading and playing around with small tutorials here and there, I came across https://www.freecodecamp.org/
and thought this would be a great way to update my knowledge of modern web development. The freeCodeCamp lessons were great,
they would provide an easy intro to a topic by working through a series of small exercises. But I've really learned a ton by working
through all of these projects. I made it a point to try to challenge myself with some new or extra feature or
technology in each project I worked on here.  I tried to avoid the easy option of just publishing these to Codepen or Glitch,
and instead went with options like Travis, GitHub pages, and Heroku. In most of my projects I tried to implement
at least basic test coverage (which was rather challenging with D3) and utilize tools like ESLint.  When I started working
with React, I leaned into using Hooks (even though freeCodeCamp didn't teach that). In my last few projects, 
I even started writing everything in Typescript (which I know love, especially when using Webstorm).

I mostly work in Java at work, so spending so much time with these other languages, working on very different types of
problems, has been a good way to improve my overall understanding of software development.  There's been several times
where I was able to apply something I learned through these projects at work, whether it be applying a specific
tool/technology or even adopting a different way of thinking about the problem.

Thanks freeCodeCamp!
